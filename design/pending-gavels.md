# Pending gavels

The single source of truth for decisions awaiting Clay — ruled so on
2026-08-23, unifying what had forked across four files. An entry is here
because it is about the language a user meets: surface, semantics,
observable behavior. Implementation details do not come here; whoever
holds the file decides them and answers for the decision in the log.

The lifecycle, restored from this file's own precedent of 2026-08-15:
an entry lives here while open; the ruling is recorded in
design/compiler-log.md, which is the history and nothing else; and the
entry leaves this file in the same commit. Everything that ever left is
one `git log -p -- design/pending-gavels.md` away.

Rules of the ledger:

- **An entry cites its search, or it is invalid.** Before filing, search
  design/compiler-log.md, design/log/compiler-log-archive.md and every
  design/*.md for the question. The entry then says what the search found
  — the ruling that partly covers it, the experiment that answers its
  premise — or states plainly that it found nothing. An entry with no
  citation line is not a pending decision; it is an unsearched one, and
  it does not go to Clay.
- **An entry carries a recommendation.** Every question below says what
  the holder of the file would do and why, so a sitting can be a yes or a
  no rather than a fresh design conversation. Where the recommendation is
  to close the question, one word does it.
- **A gaveled item carries its citation forever.** Where an entry
  survives because only part of it was ruled, the ruling's marker stays
  in the entry. This rule exists because gavel 1b's marker has now
  fallen out of this file twice — once caught and restored, once in the
  `e3052383` rewrite that made this single ledger — and each loss made a
  settled question look open. The log is append-only and cannot lose a
  fact; this file is maintained by hand and has. When the two disagree,
  the log wins.
- STATUS.md may index this file. It does not carry decision text.
- Sessions cite entries by the headings below, never by a session task
  id — a task list is private to its session and its numbers resolve
  nowhere else.
- Edits to this file ride small, promptly-merged PRs, never a feature
  branch, so the ledger cannot fork.

The residual sweep of 2026-08-25 walked the log, the archive and every
design doc for questions that were asked and never answered. What it
found is below: every remaining question asked once, with a recommendation,
so the list can be ruled in batched sittings and end. The intent is that
this is the whole of it. Six candidates the sweep turned up
were already answered by the shipped code or by a later gavel, and those
went to the log rather than here.

## Blocking — a fixture, gate, or merge is waiting

Nothing. The section stays so the next entry has somewhere to land.

## Open, not blocking

### `--explain-copies`

**Cited: part-superseded, archive 2026-07-27 — the counter stack
(`bytes_peak`, `cohort_kept`, `carry_dedup`, the trend gate, the welfare
peak terms) served the rest. What is open is only the shape below.**

The *where* half of the observability item — a diagnostic naming the
source site of each evacuation copy. Needs span plumbing through the
carry machinery.

**RECOMMENDATION: decline it until a copy surprises somebody.** The
counters already say how much is copied and when the number moves, and
nobody has yet asked which line did it. Span plumbing through the carry
machinery is a fortnight of work for a question that has not come up.

### An assert hako

**Cited: the licence half is ruled — archive 2026-08-17, assertions are
ordinary foreign rescue. What is open is the surface shape only.**

A real assertion library in the rspec direction Clay sketched —
`(expect 1) . to (equal x)` — as its own small surface design, never
improvised inside a test fix. Its arms are foreign to every tested hako,
so the err license needs nothing special. Queued 2026-08-17.

**RECOMMENDATION: build it as its own design pass, after the err
spelling above is ruled.** The matcher surface reads failures, so its
shape depends on how a failure is spelled; designing it first would mean
designing it twice.

### A bare call two imports answer alike

**Cited: INTERIM committee ruling, archive 2026-07-27, "a bare call two
imports answer alike is refused" — built, pinned, and explicitly awaiting
Clay's reassessment. `check_bare_ambiguity` is live in src/check.rs today.
The search found no reassessment.**

Two imports export the same name with the same shape, a bare call reaches
the group, and dispatch has nothing to pick by. It used to pick import
order, which the formatter forces alphabetical, so directory names decided
semantics. The interim ruling refuses the call.

**RECOMMENDATION: confirm the interim as final.** Refusing is the
conservative direction — a refused program can be given meaning by a later
gavel, and a silently-resolved one is a commitment nobody made. It has
shipped for a month without a complaint. One word retires the "interim".

### Dependency modules' render arms stay out of the root group

**Cited: recorded once, archive 2026-07-27 — "whether they should is a
surface question for Clay" — in a render-plan.md that no longer exists. The
search found nothing else, and no ruling.**

A module's render arms join its own root group across its files, so an arm
in show.kso matches a type in types.kso. Arms from a *dependency* stay
qualified and never join. A program that imports a hako defining a money
type therefore does not get that hako's rendering for free.

**RECOMMENDATION: keep them out.** Rendering is a visible property of a
value, and a dependency silently changing how a caller's output looks is
the kind of action at a distance the hako boundary exists to stop. The
owning module can export a render arm deliberately, and then the caller can
read that it did.

### `first coll n`

**Cited: design/enumerable.md §9.3, open since the 2026-07-18 ratification.
The search found `take`/`first` in the archive only as the fusion note
("take/first never fuse, so infinite sources keep their meaning"), which
does not touch the question. lib/list ships `first coll` with no n.**

Is there a `first coll n` consumer convenience, or only `take` (adapter)
plus `to_list`? One-right-way says pick one.

**RECOMMENDATION: only `take`.** `first coll` answers a different question
— one element or `none` — and giving the same name a second arity that
returns a list would make the return shape depend on the argument count.

### Where `std/` comes from

**Cited: design/hako.md, "Open questions for the observation clause",
undated. The search found no entry anywhere on how std is distributed.**

Whether `std/` ships inside the toolchain binary or as a pinned hako. It is
a user-facing question: it decides whether a program can pin a std version,
and whether upgrading the compiler can change what a program does.

**RECOMMENDATION: inside the binary, and say so.** A pinnable std means a
matrix of compiler-and-std pairs behind every differential golden, and the
oracle law is expensive enough already. The compiler version becomes the
std version, which is one number for a user to report in a bug.

### Block-born as a dataflow property

**Cited: design/memory-frontier-research.md §4.4 — "Clay's call, since it
widens what the checker admits". The original block-born rule is archive
2026-07-23 (a set target must trace to a direct constructor binding). The
search found no later ruling on widening it.**

The birthday theorem needs the cohort closed — everything born in the block,
nothing escaping — and a node reached by indexing a block-born list is in
the cohort. The shipped rule is syntactic on the binding, which is
conservative rather than necessary. Making block-born a dataflow property
(through aliases, conditionals, indexes of block-born collections, fields of
block-born nodes) is scoped compiler work, and it admits programs the
checker refuses today.

**RECOMMENDATION: hold until a real program is refused.** The case the book
teaches — wiring a cycle among a fixed set of directly-named constructions —
is what build blocks are for, and nothing in the fleet has hit the fence.
Widening a checker is easy to do later and impossible to undo.

### The interpreter's 10,000-frame guard

**Cited: archive 2026-08-15 and 2026-08-19 both record it as a documented
limit alongside the OS stack ceiling. It has been a standing offer, not a
question, since it was chosen.**

Constant chosen to hold under debug builds on the 1 GB thread.

**RECOMMENDATION: close the offer and leave the constant.** It has stood
since it was set, the accumulator rewrite removed the case that used to hit
it, and both limits are documented. If a program ever needs more, that
program is the reason to revisit it.

## Stale — the July campaign's unclosed letters (GAVELS.md, retired here)

Emptied 2026-08-26: C, D, G, Z and AA were ruled in one sitting on their
recommendations, closing the July campaign entirely. The rulings are in
the log. The composition-rules half of G survives as a parked item below.

## Parked — on the record, no action

- `<<` labels: walls cover staircases; revive on real DAG demand.
- Dispatch-group composition rules (design/function-values.md): the
  surviving half of July's G — what a group held as a value owes when
  composed. Revive when a real program composes function values.
- Labeled nameless patterns: parked 2026-08-19 — needs a fresh look
  against the post-24 language, not pending. Group headers stay behind
  it.
- dot-absorbs-`>>`: argued no — erases the visible then/bind split.
- Postfix index on `)`: `(sort xs)[1]` stays illegal; bind-then-index.
- `;` inline separator: the borrow if inline groups are ever demanded.
- `&` as bitwise: orthogonal, someday.
- `serve` / processes: the executor-loop primitive; next design
  campaign — three investigations already terminate there. The July
  reification form (an err becoming an inert Failure record at the
  supervisory boundary) died with gavel 1; the campaign starts from
  the three combinators.
- Hako tag-signing and checksum policy: parked in design/hako.md until
  something is worth attacking. The lock already carries a sha.
- Monorepo hakos (several modules per repo): the path shape allows it;
  the lock-granularity decision waits for a real case.
- Survivor cap 4× block threshold: the multiplier is a judgment call;
  the principle (the dance's transient stays at threshold scale) is in
  the log.
