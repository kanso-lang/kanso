## 2026-07-18 — Seed: state of the memory/perf frontier

Full analysis: `design/memory-frontier-research.md` (27-agent adversarial memo).

### OPEN THREADS — do not drop

- **[OPEN — top priority] In-place reuse is DEAD CODE.** `src/linear.rs`
  (linearity fixpoint) is computed + tested but consumed by NOTHING (only
  `pub mod linear;` in lib.rs). `k_b_push_mut` (runtime.c:1319) is called by
  nothing; codegen emits no `push_mut`/`dup`/`drop`. Yet the 16-byte
  `KHeader{rc,pad}` sits on every heap object. → we pay the Perceus header tax
  with ZERO reuse benefit. FIX: thread the linear analysis into codegen to select
  `k_b_push_mut` on proven-unique lists; add an observable-allocation-count test
  (not a unit test on the analysis); measure the spine case first.
  **MEMORY-CORRUPTION-SENSITIVE — x86 gate, Clay watching.** (memo §0, §3.1)

- **[OPEN] Delete the 16-byte `KHeader` from arena objects.** Runtime RC on a bump
  arena is strictly negative (settled doctrine). We pay it for nothing today.
  MEMORY-SENSITIVE. (memo §2)

- **[OPEN] The TAG is the serde gap — not memory.** The ~13% to serde is
  tagged-value representation + per-call dispatch; allocation is already at serde
  parity. The lever is **tag-hoist under monomorphism speculation** (hoist element
  tag out of the hot loop, bail to the scalar path on failure). This — NOT the
  reuse-wiring — is what could close the serde SPEED gap. SPECULATIVE; measure
  before claiming. Do NOT conflate with the reuse fix. (memo §1, §4)

- **[OPEN — before regions ship] Cohort-birthday ratchet TEST.** "Cycles cannot
  cross birthdays" soundness rests on one "X can never happen" claim (the shape
  that shipped the kramdown crash). Write an adversarial property test — a
  build-block capturing + mutating an already-frozen outer value — BEFORE
  cohort/region codegen is load-bearing. Adversarial proof, not assertion.
  (memo §3.7)

- **[OPEN] Survivor double-write.** The unbuilt survivor path writes survivor
  bytes twice (bench + shelf). Three-way escape split (dies-this-beat / MUST-
  survive → born-in-shelf / MAY-survive → copy) fixes it; gating on MAY instead of
  MUST is a cross-beat leak. Measure survivor volume on VSE first. (memo §3.4)

### SPECULATIVE / NEW GROUND (survived adversarial attack; each needs an experiment)

- Static reuse-in-place inside the build-block (shape-preserving rebuild, 2x→1x
  peak); tag-hoist (above); auto-SoA via whole-program field-touch (gated on a
  NUMERIC workload, not JSON; co-selected against fusion); build-blocks as the
  host for in-place graph algorithms (union-find, compile-time e-graph, NbE).

### DECISIONS / HISTORY

- **[DONE] Beats / heartbeat arena** — bump-alloc + O(1) rewind; JSON decoder flat
  ~7.1MB, serde memory parity. Genuinely the frontier for MANAGEMENT (beats
  generational GC's O(live) trace; MLKit PLDI'02 confirms "regions alone, no GC"
  fastest where the discipline fits).
- **[REFUTED] do not resurrect without new evidence:** runtime RC on the arena;
  interaction nets (~10x slower on numeric — Asperti's own retrospective); heap
  register-allocation as a memory model; one-e-graph co-scheduling of
  layout+lifetime+reuse; sub-beat mini-rewinds keyed to arm last-use;
  beat-offset TRMC as a memory win; optimal beat-boundary min-cost-cut with
  survivors (its survivor term IS a copying-GC minor collection). (memo §6)
- **[REVERTED — measured neutral, don't re-try blind]** in-place put/maps;
  find_byte (2-memchr double scan); bytes-view fusion (~2% ceiling); inline record
  fields; utf8 ASCII fast path.
- **[DONE — compiler wins]** field-set inference; caught-failure propagation;
  unboxed-scalar ABI; register-return + escape analysis; unboxed dispatch;
  copy-elim bundle. Cumulative JSON decode ~1.93 → ~1.27ms.
- **[STANDING] hand-opts to back out as the compiler improves:** find2 +
  number-from-bytes (json-stdlib hand-compilation, ~10%). Back out once fusion +
  loop-generation-from-tail-recursion exist, and confirm the number holds.

## 2026-07-18 (later) — Pursuing tag-hoist; RECONCILE the gap first

Clay wants to chase tag-hoist (the speculative representation lever). Before
building it, **step 0: re-profile the current JSON decode** — two of our own
sources disagree on what the serde gap even is:

- **[CONFLICT]** memo / `compiler.html §11` says the ~13% gap is REPRESENTATION
  (tagged values + per-call dispatch). But the perf campaign's overnight
  diagnosis (above) measured the gap as ALLOCATION, not dispatch ("LLVM already
  folds the boxing across calls"), and unboxed-dispatch shipped for only ~3-4%.
  These can't both be current truth. **RE-PROFILE before committing** — point the
  work at the confirmed lever (tag-hoist if representation, reuse-wiring if
  allocation). Do not build tag-hoist on the §11 claim alone.

- **[OPEN, plan] tag-hoist mechanism** (if representation confirmed): speculate a
  collection is monomorphic in element tag, hoist the tag check out of the hot
  loop, run the body on raw payloads, bail-restart to the tagged path on
  violation (reuse the int-tiering AOT-restart mechanism). First cut = a CEILING
  EXPERIMENT: hand-hack the tag-hoisted fast path on the hottest loop (unsound,
  throwaway), measure the recovery vs the 13%. Real ceiling → build sound; noise →
  drop it (cf. the bytes-view fusion ceiling that measured ~2% and was parked).

## 2026-07-18 (step 0 RESULT) — Gap is REPRESENTATION; reuse correction

Re-profiled the current JSON decode (main, 3000×, macOS `sample`). VERIFIED:

- **The gap is DISPATCH/REPRESENTATION, not allocation.** Self-time split:
  dispatch/repr **53.5%** (d__value_for 469 = single hottest fn in the program;
  k_truthy 169 = guard/failure-bit overhead; the d__* dispatchers), alloc/
  construct 23.3%, copy 6.7%, str/num parse 16.5%. Confirms `compiler.html §11`.
  The earlier campaign "gap is allocation" note was STALE (pre-copy-elim; those
  wins moved the bottleneck to representation). → **tag/representation IS the
  lever; reuse-wiring is NOT the serde-speed lever.**

- **CORRECTION to the seed entry / memo §0:** the reuse is PARTIALLY wired, NOT
  fully dead. `k_b_push_mut` IS emitted (11× in jsonprof.ll, 202 samples) —
  in-place list-append fires via the runtime frontier-buffer trick, NOT via
  linear.rs. The memo's "push_mut called by nothing" was WRONG and I repeated it
  (macOS BSD-grep `\|`-is-literal bug hid it — use `-E` or single-term greps).
  STILL DEAD, confirmed vs the IR: `linear.rs` (general reuse analysis, 0
  `linear::` callers) and `k_dup`/`k_drop` (0 emissions) while the 16-byte KHeader
  is still on every object. So "delete the header" STANDS; "wire or delete the
  dead general reuse analysis" STANDS; "the in-place win doesn't fire at all" is
  FALSE (append fires).

- **Tag-hoist nuance (aim precisely):** d__value_for dispatches on the INPUT BYTE
  (data-dependent recursive descent), NOT a monomorphic collection element — so
  classic collection-tag-hoist doesn't map onto it. Real levers on d__value_for +
  k_truthy: (a) elide failure-bit/k_truthy plumbing where inference proves
  no-failure (169 samples pure guard overhead); (b) deeper KValue unboxing across
  the dispatch boundary. NEXT CEILING EXPERIMENT: strip the failure-bit/truthy
  checks in the hot dispatch path, measure recovery vs the ~13%.

## 2026-07-18 (experiment RESULT) — serde gap is SIMD, NOT representation; kanso beats naive Rust

Fresh baseline (this machine, best-of-10 ms/decode; kanso timed as a 3000× binary
so startup is negligible; naive/serde self-report decode-only mean):

| decoder | ms/decode |
|---|---|
| kanso | 0.932 |
| naive Rust (recursive descent, std String/Vec/HashMap) | 0.988 |
| serde_json | 0.846 |

- **kanso BEATS naive Rust by 5.6%.** The reframed campaign goal (beat reasonable
  native Rust, not serde) is ACHIEVED.
- **The ~10% serde gap is SIMD/zero-copy, NOT representation.** naive Rust — native
  types, zero tags, zero dispatch-boxing — is **16.7% behind serde**, MORE behind
  than kanso. A tag-free decoder does NOT close the serde gap ⇒ representation is
  not the serde gap.
- **This REFUTES the memo §11 premise AND the step-0 "tag is the serde gap"
  conclusion.** The profile's 53% dispatch/representation is kanso's INTERNAL
  self-time; cutting it widens kanso's lead over naive, but serde's SIMD lead is
  untouched. The two earlier claims were reasoning from an internal profile to an
  external gap — invalid; the cross-decoder comparison is the correct instrument.
- **CONSEQUENCE — tag-hoist DOWNGRADED:** do NOT build it expecting to crush serde;
  measured, the win isn't there. It would extend a naive-Rust lead we already hold.
  Beating serde specifically needs simdjson-class SIMD byte-classification — a
  separate, harder frontier — and per Clay's 2026-07-14 reframe serde was never the
  right north star. The tag-hoist OPEN thread above is superseded by this entry.
